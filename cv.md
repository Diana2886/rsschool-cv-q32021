## About myself

I have been working in the civil service for many years. Working strictly on schedule in the office and doing uninteresting work, I came to the conclusion that I completely wanted to change my life. Namely, to change the daily routine, be able to work remotely, develop in terms of career growth and, as a result, have a decent salary.\
I am not a beginner in the field of information technology, as I graduated from the university with a degree in systems engineer. Therefore, the study of the field of programming is given to me well.\
Today my goal is to become a good programmer. To achieve my goal, I completely immersed myself in learning new information and hope to get enough practical skills through this course.
